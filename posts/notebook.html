            <p>
                Between 6th and 12th grade I maintained a composition notebook of modest observations and insights I stumbled across over the years. While these results are too small to warrant individual blogs, I packaged some of the more memorable results for reference.
            </p>
            <h>Rethinking the Quadratic Formula</h>
            <p>
                Painless Algebra is a book written by former university professor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynette_Long" target="_blank">Lynette Long</a>. Without proof, she states the quadratic formula as follows:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>When you use the quadratic formula, you can solve quadratic equations without factoring. Just put the equation in standard form \( ax^{2} + bx + c = 0 \). Substitute the values for \( a \), \( b \) and \( c \) in this equation and simplify.
                \[
                    x = \frac{{-b \pm \sqrt{{b^2-4ac}}}}{{2a}}
                \]</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Of course, the quadratic formula isn't all that hard to show. The standard approach essentially amounts to performing a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completing_the_square" target="_blank">completing the square</a> in the general case. In fact, it is so straightforward, that I can safely copy a proof written by Open AIs flagship model <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a>.

            <p>
                Here, our goal is to reformulate the Quadratic Formula by appealing to symmetry. We'll start by noting that Quadratic Functions are commonly expressed in three different ways:
            </p>
                <ol>
                    <li> Standard Form: \(q(x) = ax^{2} + bx + c \)
                    <li> Factored Form: \(q(x) = a(x - r_{1})(x - r_{2}) \)
                    <li> Vertex Form: \( q(x) = a(x - h)^{2} + k \)
                </ol>
            <p>
                We impose conditions on these constants. In particular, \( a, b, c, h, k \in \mathbb{R} \) with \(a \ne 0 \) (to prevent degeneracy) and roots \( r_{1}, r_{2} \in \mathbb{C} \). The existence of these roots is guranteed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra" target="_blank">The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The high-level plan of attack is to find the vertex in terms of the coefficients. From there, we'll figure out how much to move to the right and left in order to reach the roots.
            </p>

                <figcaption>Horizontal Symmetry Persists Despite Vertical Offset by Constant \( c \)</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Since we're interested in the finding the vertex, we'll start by taking a look at the Vertex Form. Upon inspection, it is clear that quadratic functions are symmetric with respect to \( x = h \). We can use this symmetry to our advantage. In particular, we define \( q_{p} = ax^{2} + bx \) (shown in dashes) whose vertex notably shares the same \( x \)-coordinate. We directly compute the roots as \( q_{p} = x (ax + b) = 0 \) which implies \( x = 0, -\frac{b}{a} \) in general. From symmetry, we reason that the vertex lies between these two roots at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \) in both cases. Plugging this value, we find \( q \left ( -\frac{b}{2a}  \right ) = c - \frac{b^{2}}{4a} \) giving us the \( x \) and \( y \) coordinates of the vertex.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this point, our task is to find \( \Delta \) such that \( q \left ( -\frac{b}{2a} \pm \Delta  \right ) = 0 \). Since this seems a bit cumbersome to compute directly, we'll take another look at the Vertex Form. Upon further inspection, we arrive at the following expansion: \( q(x) = ax^{2} - 2ahx + ah^{2} + k \). Comparing terms from Standard Form, we notice that \( b = -2ah \) and \( c = ah^{2} + k \) allowing us to arbitrarily tune both coefficients by changing the position of the vertex. In other words, \( b \) and \( c \) only influence the position of the vertex and not the overall shape of the graph! We now reason that moving \( \Delta \) units to the left or right of the vertex has the effect of moving up or down \( a \Delta^{2} \) units!
                \[
                    a \Delta^{2} + \left ( c - \frac{b^{2}}{4a} \right ) = 0
                    \implies
                    \Delta = \frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
                \]
                Adding back the \( x \)-coordinate of the vertex and simplifying everything, we arrive at the quadratic formula.
                \[
                    x = 
                    -\frac{b}{2a} \pm \Delta = 
                    \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
                \]
                This reformulation not only simplifies the algebra in favour of geometric insights, but it also allows us to attach an elegant interpretation to each component in this formula.

            <h>Mesolabe Compass</h>
            <p>
                Numberphile is an educational YouTube channel featuring videos that explore topics from a variety of fields of mathematics. Several years ago, one particular video (that has since been <a href="https://youtu.be/9VVPBS_flOI?si=9zU92bcDl0RAvSej" target="_blank">remastered</a>) caught my attention. Here, professor Johnny Ball discusses the Mesolabe Compass and its connection to square roots. I'll save you the trouble of watching the entire video and include the main figure here for reference.

            <p>
                The question, of course, is why the \( \sqrt{a} \) pops up here. As it so happens, this isn't too difficult to explain. From Thale's Theorem, we know \( \measuredangle ABC \) is a right angle. From here we determine that the two triangle created by dropping the altitude are similiar to each other since they share the same angles. Letting \( h \) stand for the altitude, we establish the following relation:
                \[
                    \frac{h}{a} = \frac{1}{h} \implies h = \sqrt{a}
                \]
                I suppose the second question that comes to mind is why Thale's Theorem holds. One approach that immediately surfaces is to apply the more general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inscribed_angle" target="_blank">Inscribed Angle Theorem</a> to a chord that happens to also be a diameter. Another approach, that I personally find interesting, is to consider the set of points such that the lines connecting \( (-r, 0) \) to \( (x, y) \) and \( (x, y) \) to \( (r, 0) \) are perpendicular to each other. Using point-slope form and enforcing that the slopes are perpendicular (negative reciprocals), we arrive at the following equations.
                \[
                    y - 0 = m (x + r)
                    \hspace{0.5em} \text{and} \hspace{0.5em}
                    y - 0 = -\frac{1}{m} (x - r)
                \]
                Solving for \( m \) we rewrite this system.
                \[
                    m = \frac{y}{x + r} = - \frac{x - r}{y} 
                    \implies
                    x^{2} + y^{2} = r^{2}
                \]
                Amazingly, it turns out that the only set of points that ensure the two lines are perpendicular are those belonging to a circle!
