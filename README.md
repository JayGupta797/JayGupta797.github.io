### Hello There ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for dropping by my personal website! My name is Jay Gupta and I am a resident of the sunny city of San Jose, California. A Bay Area kid through and through, I am currently a sophomore at Stanford University working towards a Bachelors in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics.

If I were to describe my interests, you might say they're a bit all over the map. In my recent past, I have had interests ranging from aquaponics to woodworking to public policy. To be honest, sometimes even I struggle to find a pattern in the madness! But if you look closely, there's one thing that ties it all together: my deep concern for people. My driving force is the hope that my work will have a positive impact on individuals as real as you and me.

With that nugget of motivation out of the way, this website is intended to act as a sort of digital diary---a record of my projects and interests over the years to come. I hope you enjoy reading as much as I enjoy writing!

To end things off, here is some quick Q&A
