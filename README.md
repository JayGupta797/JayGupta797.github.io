## Hello There ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for dropping by my personal website! My name is Jay Gupta and I am from the sunny city of San Jose, California. A Bay Area resident through and through, I am currently a junior at Stanford University working towards a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science.

My interests are diverse, but recently I have grown fascinated by Natural Language Processing and Generation particularly with respect to mechanistic interpretability. I am concerned about the future and looming existential risks ranging from AI Alignment to Nuclear Warfare. Still, I am optimistic that advances in deep learning will transform the world for the better. My driving force is the hope that my work will have a positive impact on individuals as real as you and me.

With that nugget of motivation out of the way, this site is intended to act as a record of my projects and interests over the years to come. I hope you enjoy reading as much as I enjoy writing!

## Attributions
The overall design of this site was inspired by the [minimal mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/minimal-mistakes/) Jekyll Theme. The resume section builds off Xiaoying Riley's [template](https://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/bootstrap-templates/resume/free-bootstrap-resume-cv-template-for-developers-pillar/) though several modifications were made. I referenced several answers listed on Stack Overflow to implement tricky behaviors. These attributions are made in the source code itself.

## Performance
Pages achieve reasonable scores on [pagespeed](https://pagespeed.web.dev) for performance. The major bottleneck are 3rd party resources (i.e., MathJax, Prism.js, etc) that delay the page load for a few hundred miliseconds.
